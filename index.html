        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Megan James and I am currently a first year psychology major at the University of California, Riverside. I want to pursue a career within the field of psychology because the human brain and why it does what it does has always interested me. I enjoy having a well rounded education and am always striving to learn something new. I try to take classes that will challenge my existing knowledge as well as expand my understanding of the world around me. I am a hard worker, very conscientious, and extremely dependable. I am always eager to learn new things and gain new experiences which is why I chose to attend UC Riverside. Moving more than 240 miles from home before I was eighteen was definitely an opportunity for me to grow and mature as a person. I am looking forward to expanding on my experiences at UCR both in and out of the classroom before I graduate.<br><br>

        I was employed as a cashier at the Lothian Dining Hall beginning in January 2020. I felt that it was very important to have a job while also pursuing my college degree. I had various duties including, but not limited to, handling card swipes, making sure products were always restocked, and cleaning tables. In my short time there before the campus closure, I gained a reputation with my management as being a reliable employee who was a fast learner. Because of this, I was exposed to all the different positions within the dining hall which provided me the opportunity to fill in for any position instead of being stuck at one position. I value the experiences I have gained and am looking forward to returning to my position once the UCR campus opens again.<br><br>

        During high school I worked as a Theatrical Lighting Technician for plays and musicals. I designed and operated the complete lighting plans for the shows and performances. I programmed the light board during rehearsals and operated the light board during the performances. In developing a lighting plan for a show, I had to work closely with the directors to understand their vision and the way I could bring it to life. Working closely with a team of adults as a high school student was challenging but very rewarding. Having this job taught me the importance of problem solving and learning as I go.<br><br>
        
        As soon as I was old enough to acquire any sort of job, I started babysitting. Over the years, I have babysat many children from many different families. I was eager to start building myself up as a respectable businessperson and to earn money that was my own. In order to get more clients and be respected as a babysitter, I had to portray that I was a responsible person capable of taking care of someone else. There are many things that go into babysitting such as making sure I had all emergency contacts necessary, being C.P.R. certified, and making sure every child was taken care of properly and that they were happy.
